# Mathematical Legacy Archive

This file preserves any removed or refactored mathematical structures for future reference.

For each entry, include:
- Date
- File/Function/Class
- Original code (or equation)
- Reason/context for removal or refactor
- What replaced it (if anything)

---

**Example:**

- Date: 2024-06-28
- File: core/recursive_lattice_theorem.py
- Function: def old_phase_grade()
- Original code:
```python
def old_phase_grade(lambda_val, mu_val):
    return int((lambda_val / mu_val) % 8)
```
- Reason: Replaced by new PhaseGrade Enum logic for clarity and safety
- Replacement: See class PhaseGrade
