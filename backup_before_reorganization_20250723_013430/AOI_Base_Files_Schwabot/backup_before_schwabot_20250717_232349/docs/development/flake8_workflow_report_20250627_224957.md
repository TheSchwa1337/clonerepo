- ❌ math_structure_report.md (not found)
- ❌ prune_candidates_report.md (not found)

## 📋 Next Steps
1. **Review the analysis reports** - Understand what errors exist
2. **Check auto-fix results** - Verify mathematical structures were preserved
3. **Address critical errors** - Fix syntax and import issues manually
4. **Test functionality** - Ensure the codebase still works correctly
5. **Iterate** - Run this workflow again if needed

## 🔧 Manual Fix Recommendations
- **E999 (Syntax errors)**: Fix syntax issues manually
- **F821 (Undefined names)**: Add missing imports or define variables
- **F822 (Undefined names in __all__)**: Fix __all__ declarations
- **F823 (Local variable referenced before assignment)**: Fix variable scope
- **F831 (Duplicate argument name)**: Fix function signatures
- **F841 (Local variable assigned but never used)**: Remove unused variables
- **F901 (Return statement with assignment)**: Refactor complex returns

## 🔬 Mathematical Structure Preservation
- Files marked with 🔬 contain mathematical logic
- Always review changes to these files carefully
- Use `math_legacy.md` to preserve removed mathematical structures
- Test mathematical functions after any changes
