## üßÆ **MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION**

### **Core Equation**
```
M_{n+1} = Œ≥¬∑M_n + Œ≤¬∑Œ©_n¬∑ŒîŒ®_n¬∑(1 + Œæ¬∑E_n)
```

Where:
- **Œ≥ (gamma)**: Fractal persistence constant (0.9)
- **Œ≤ (beta)**: Adjustment strength (0.1)
- **Œ©_n (omega)**: Live volatility from market data
- **ŒîŒ®_n (delta psi)**: Bit-phase fluctuation drift
- **Œæ (xi)**: Environmental coefficient (0.05)
- **E_n**: Environmental entropy from market conditions

### **Bit-Phase Analysis**
```
Phase Drift = Œ£(Œ∏_i ¬∑ Flip(b_i))
```

Where:
- **Œ∏_i**: Relevance weights for prior fractal zones
- **Flip(b_i)**: Local SHA hash variance from tick sequences
- **Patterns**: `()()()()()()` and `)(()(shifted pattern organized bit phase drift)())()()(`

### **Pattern Recognition**
```
P(A,B) = argmax_t(dP_A/dt ¬∑ f(B))
```

Where:
- **P_A**: Price vector of asset A
- **f(B)**: Expected delta-probability at time B
- **Result**: Highest return potential given time-phase and market signal memory
