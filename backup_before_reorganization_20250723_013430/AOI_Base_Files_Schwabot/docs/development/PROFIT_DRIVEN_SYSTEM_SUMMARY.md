## Mathematical Foundation

### Core Mathematical Components

The system uses five mathematical components for comprehensive market analysis:

#### 1. ALEPH Hash Similarity (25% weight)
```
Hash Similarity = sin²(hash_transform(market_state) × π/2)
```
- Maps market state to hash values for similarity analysis
- Provides unique fingerprinting of market conditions
- Helps identify similar historical patterns

#### 2. Phase Alignment (20% weight)
```
Phase Alignment = momentum_consistency × alignment_strength
```
- Analyzes momentum consistency across timeframes
- Detects phase transitions in market behavior
- Validates directional conviction

#### 3. NCCO Entropy Score (20% weight)
```
Entropy Score = tanh(1/(1 + volatility×100) × 2) × 0.8 + 0.1
```
- Measures market predictability through entropy analysis
- Lower volatility indicates higher predictability
- Validates signal reliability

#### 4. Drift Weight (20% weight)
```
Drift Weight = 1/(1 + combined_drift×20)
```
- Compensates for temporal and spatial drift
- Uses exponentially weighted moving averages
- Accounts for market acceleration/deceleration

#### 5. Pattern Confidence (15% weight)
```
Pattern Confidence = |correlation(price_changes, volume_changes)| + consistency_bonus
```
- Analyzes price-volume relationships
- Detects trend consistency patterns
- Validates trading signals

### Composite Confidence Score
```
Confidence = 0.25×Hash + 0.20×Phase + 0.20×Entropy + 0.20×Drift + 0.15×Pattern
```

### Profit Potential Calculation
```
Profit Potential = volatility_profit × volume_factor × momentum_factor × confidence_score
```

### Risk Assessment
```
Risk Score = confidence_risk + volatility_risk + volume_risk + profit_risk
```

## Trading Decision Logic

### Entry Criteria (All Must Be Met)
1. **Confidence Threshold**: Composite confidence ≥ 75%
2. **Profit Threshold**: Expected profit ≥ 0.5%
3. **Risk Threshold**: Risk score ≤ 30%
4. **Phase Alignment**: Strong momentum alignment detected
5. **Mathematical Validation**: All components within acceptable ranges

### Position Sizing (Kelly Criterion)
```
Kelly Fraction = (p × b - q) / b
Where:
- p = win probability (confidence score)
- q = loss probability (1 - confidence)
- b = win/loss ratio
```

**Safety Constraints:**
- Maximum Kelly fraction: 25%
- Conservative factor: 50% of calculated Kelly
- Maximum position size: 10% of portfolio
- Minimum edge required: 10%

### Exit Strategy
```
Take Profit = current_price × (1 + profit_factor × profit_potential)
Stop Loss = current_price × (1 - loss_factor × risk_score)
```
