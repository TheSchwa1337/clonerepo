## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced State Management
```python
from core.internal_state import EnhancedStateManager, SystemMode, LogLevel

# Create enhanced manager in demo mode
manager = EnhancedStateManager(mode=SystemMode.DEMO, log_level=LogLevel.INFO)

# Store memory with TTL
manager.store_memory("trading_data", {"price": 50000, "volume": 1000}, ttl=3600.0)

# Add backlog entry
entry_id = manager.add_backlog_entry(5, {"action": "process"}, "trading", "memory")

# Generate BTC price hash
btc_hash = manager.generate_btc_price_hash(50000.0, 1000.0, 32)

# Create demo state
demo_state = manager.create_demo_state(50000.0, 1000.0, 32, {"extra": "data"})
```

### System Integration
```python
from core.internal_state import SystemIntegration, SystemMode, LogLevel

# Create system integration
integration = SystemIntegration(mode=SystemMode.DEMO, log_level=LogLevel.INFO)

# Create demo state with system integration
demo_state = integration.create_demo_state_with_btc_hash(
    50000.0, 1000.0, 32, {"integration_test": "data"}
)

# Get comprehensive system status
status = integration.get_comprehensive_system_status()

# Run system test
test_results = integration.run_system_test(test_duration=60)
```

### BTC Price Hashing
```python
from core.internal_state import BTCPriceHash

# Generate BTC price hash
btc_hash = BTCPriceHash.from_price_data(50000.0, 1000.0, 32)

# Access hash properties
print(f"Price: {btc_hash.price}")
print(f"Volume: {btc_hash.volume}")
print(f"Hash: {btc_hash.hash_value}")
print(f"Phase: {btc_hash.phase}")
print(f"Agent: {btc_hash.agent}")
```
