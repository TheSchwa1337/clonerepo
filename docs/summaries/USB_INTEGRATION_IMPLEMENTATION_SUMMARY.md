#### 2. `AOI_Base_Files_Schwabot/schwabot_launcher.py` (Enhanced)
- **Added USB tab** with status display and setup options
- **Integrated USB detection** on startup
- **Real-time status updates** for USB drives
- **Seamless integration** with existing launcher functionality

#### 3. `test_usb_integration.py` (New)
- **Comprehensive test suite** for all USB functionality
- **Integration testing** with launcher and API key manager
- **Validation of all features** and error handling

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic Detection Flow
1. **Launcher starts** and automatically detects USB drives
2. **If API keys exist** and USB drives are detected, user is prompted
3. **User can choose** to deploy API keys to USB for secure storage
4. **Setup process** creates .env file and organized folders
5. **Status updates** in real-time throughout the process

### API Key Deployment Process
1. **Load existing API keys** from the API key manager
2. **Decrypt keys** using the same encryption method
3. **Convert key paths** to .env variable format
4. **Generate .env file** with actual API keys and placeholders
5. **Create secure folder structure** for data management

### Folder Structure Created
```
USB_DRIVE/
├── .env                          # API keys and configuration
└── Schwabot_Data/
    ├── Backup_Data/              # Trading data backups
    ├── Registry_Files/           # System registry
    ├── Memory_Keys/              # Memory and cache
    ├── Trading_Logs/             # Trading activity logs
    ├── Performance_Data/         # Performance metrics
    ├── Backtest_Results/         # Backtesting data
    └── System_Backups/           # System configuration backups
```

## 📋 User Experience

### Automatic Prompts
When a USB drive is detected and API keys are configured:
```
🔐 USB Security Setup Available

Detected 1 USB drive(s) and existing API keys.

Would you like to deploy your API keys to a USB drive for secure storage?

This will:
• Create a .env file with your API keys
• Set up organized folders for trading data
• Enable secure offloading of backtesting data

Available drives:
• E:\ - USB Drive (14.2GB free)
```

### Launcher Interface
