Perform vectorized dot product for weighted vector combination
supporting both static and dynamic weight updates.

Args:
        weights: Weight coefficients array
vectors: Vector matrix (weights axis should align)

Returns:
        Projected vector result

Raises:
        ValueError: If dimension mismatch occurs"""
