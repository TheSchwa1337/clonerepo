# üöÄ Getting Started with Schwabot

## Welcome to Schwabot!

Schwabot is an advanced AI-powered trading system that combines cutting-edge mathematical frameworks with GPU acceleration to provide automated trading capabilities. This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your system
- **CUDA-compatible GPU** (optional, but recommended for best performance)
- **Trading API credentials** from your preferred exchange (Coinbase, etc.)
- **Basic understanding** of cryptocurrency trading concepts

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd clonerepo
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
```bash
python AOI_Base_Files_Schwabot/main.py --system-status
```

You should see a status report indicating the system is ready.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Setting Up API Credentials

1. **Navigate to the config directory:**
   ```bash
   cd AOI_Base_Files_Schwabot/config
   ```

2. **Edit the coinbase profiles file:**
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   notepad coinbase_profiles.yaml
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   nano coinbase_profiles.yaml
   ```

3. **Add your API credentials:**
   ```yaml
   profiles:
     default:
       api_key: "your_api_key_here"
       api_secret: "your_api_secret_here"
       sandbox: true  # Set to false for live trading
       trading_pairs: ["BTC/USDC", "ETH/USDC"]
       position_limits:
         max_open_positions: 5
         max_position_size: 1000
   ```

### Important Security Notes
- **Never commit your API keys** to version control
- **Start with sandbox mode** to test the system safely
- **Use strong, unique API keys** with limited permissions
- **Enable 2FA** on your exchange account

### Option B: Command Line Interface (Advanced Users)

The CLI provides advanced control and automation capabilities.

**Basic commands:**
```bash
# Check system status
python AOI_Base_Files_Schwabot/main.py --system-status

# Run system tests
python AOI_Base_Files_Schwabot/main.py --run-tests

# Start backtesting
python AOI_Base_Files_Schwabot/main.py --backtest --days 30

# Get GPU information
python AOI_Base_Files_Schwabot/main.py --gpu-info
```

## üéØ Your First Trading Session

### Starting with Demo Mode

**We strongly recommend starting with demo mode** to learn the system without risking real funds.

1. **Launch the web interface** (if using the dashboard)
2. **Switch to demo mode** in the session controls
3. **Configure a test strategy** with low confidence settings
4. **Execute the strategy** and observe the results
5. **Review the logs** to understand the decision-making process
