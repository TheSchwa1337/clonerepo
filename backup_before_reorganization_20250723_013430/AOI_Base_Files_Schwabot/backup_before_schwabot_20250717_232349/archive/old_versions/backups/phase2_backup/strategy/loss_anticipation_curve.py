        Loss Anticipation Curve Module



        -----------------------------



        Implements a predictive model to anticipate potential losses based on various



        market and internal metrics. This module helps in proactive risk management



        and dynamic position sizing by providing an estimated loss curve.







            Key functionalities include:



            - Data collection and pre-processing for loss prediction.



            - Predictive modeling using statistical or machine learning techniques.



            - Calculation of a 'loss curve' indicating potential downside at different scenarios.



            - Integration with risk management systems.  # Assuming these might be available from other core
            modules



            # from core.risk_manager import RiskMetric, RiskManagementSystem



            # from core.portfolio_tracker import PortfolioSnapshot
