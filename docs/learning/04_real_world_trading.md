```bash
python AOI_Base_Files_Schwabot/launch_unified_interface.py
```
Then open: http://localhost:8080

**For Advanced Users:**
```bash
python AOI_Base_Files_Schwabot/main.py --system-status
```

### **Step 2: Start with Demo Mode**

**ALWAYS start with demo mode first:**
- Test patterns without real money
- See how the system works
- Build confidence in the approach
- Learn the interface

**How to enable demo mode:**
- In the web dashboard, look for "Demo Mode" toggle
- Switch it ON before making any trades
- Practice with virtual money first

### **Step 3: Understand What You See**

**In the Web Dashboard:**

**Portfolio Panel:**
- **Portfolio Value**: Total money
- **Total Profit**: How much has been made/lost
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of successful trades
- **Active Strategies**: How many trades are running

**Strategy Panel:**
- **Strategy ID**: Name for the trading strategy
- **Asset**: What to trade (BTC, ETH, etc.)
- **Confidence**: How sure the system is (0.1 - 1.0)
- **Signal Strength**: How strong the market signal is

**Pattern Display:**
- **Current Pattern**: Bit phases ()()()()()()
- **Pattern Confidence**: How reliable the pattern is
- **Next Prediction**: What the system thinks will happen

## üß† Intuitive Approach in Action

### **How the Questions Work:**

**"What is price of A":**
- System shows: "Current BTC price: $43,250"
- Users know exactly what A is

**"Can we make profit if time is B":**
- System calculates: "If you wait 1 hour, potential profit is +$150"
- Users know if waiting is worth it

**"Did we make profit from actions a and b":**
- System tracks: "Action a (buy) + Action b (sell) = +$75 profit"
- Users know exactly what actions accomplished

**"Profit potential":**
- System shows: "Current profit potential = 78.5%"
- Users know the overall opportunity

### **How Patterns Work:**

**Bit Phases ()()()()()():**
- System detects: "Regular pattern detected"
- Users see patterns working

**Shifted Patterns:**
- System tracks: "Pattern shifting: )(()(drift)())()()("
- Users see pattern evolution

**Observation Learning:**
- System learns: "Based on observations, market is trending up"
- The system gets smarter over time

## üìä Making Your First Trade

### **Step 1: Check Patterns**
- Look at the pattern display
- See if bit phases are clear
- Check pattern confidence level

### **Step 2: Set Parameters**
- **Strategy ID**: Give the trade a name
- **Asset**: Choose what to trade (BTC recommended)
- **Confidence**: Start with 0.5 (medium confidence)
- **Signal Strength**: Start with 0.5 (medium signal)

### **Step 3: Execute the Trade**
- Click "Execute Strategy"
- Watch the system work
- Monitor the results

### **Step 4: Track Results**
- Watch profit/loss
- See how patterns performed
- Learn from the outcome

## üéØ Best Practices for Safe Trading
